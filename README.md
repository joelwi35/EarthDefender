# EarthDefender

EarthDefender was a simple game written by Joel Wiljanen for a work hackathon.  The goal was to learn how to use Unity, and present it to my team in a fun, playable manner.  It requires the Unity app and Engine to run and is best played with a controller plugged into a USB port on your local computer.  

It was designed and written in 2 daysâ€™ time following 3 days of learning Unity via the various well written sample apps.  Feel free to take the code and use it in any way you want to and expand upon or change its core design to make it even better.

# How to Play
EarthDefender is simply a shooting game where waves of asteroid and alien ships continually hurtle toward the Earth while you rotate a gun around the planet and fire one of 3 different types of ordinances back at the onslaught in attempt to save Earth's 7.3 billion inhabitants. 

If any objects reach the earth, the population will suffer and fall.  If the Earth's population falls to zero before you destroy the slow-moving alien Mother Ship, you lose. If you can stave off all invaders long enough while also dropping the Mother Ship's shields and finishing it off, you win.

# Ordinances

There are 3 types of defensive ordinances at your disposal.  Some enemies are immune to one or two ordinance types so experiment to figure out what works for each incoming foe.

1. Rockets. Rockets are effective against most non shielded foes, such as asteroids.
2. Lasers.  Lasers are effective against alien craft.
3. Lightning (ion cannon).  Lightning is used to bring down shielded foes, and the only ordinance that will eventually lower the Mother Ship's shields.

# Controls

With an Xbox game controller (recommended)

The left thumb stick is used to rotate the Earth's lone "gun" around the planet in a 360 degree arc, either clockwise, or counter-clockwise.  

The 'B' button fires rockets.

The 'X' button fires purple lightning blasts.

The 'A' button fires blue lasers.

# Power Ups

Destroyed enemies sometimes drop rotating cubes of different colors.  Hitting any cube will temporarily increase the firing rate of the corresponding-colored ordinance.  Use the increased fire power to wipe out the incoming hordes.

# Enemies

There are several different types of enemies.  Some move around randomly.  Some teleport around.  Some shoot at the earth.  Some try to crash into the Earth.  Each enemy poses a different threat to Earth's diminishing population. Have fun figuring out how to effectively deal with each via experimentation.

# Long Range Scanners

In the lower left corner of the game window is a "zoomed out" view of offscreen threats.  You will see enemies coming before they are in range on the main screen.  You can use this view to focus fire that direction as enemies approach.  This view is particularly useful to know which direction the Mother Ship is approaching from and how close it is to the Earth.

# The Mother Ship

The Mother Ship is massive. The Earth cannot sustain contact with it.  It is heavily shielded.  Only ion blasts will weaken its shields.  You must try to continually deal with all other threats approaching and attacking the Earth while simultaneously trying to lower the Mother Ship's shields.  Its shields will indicate they are weaking as they continually change color to a deeper shade of red.  If you successfully destroy its shield, finish it off quickly, and you will win.
